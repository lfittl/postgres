 <title>pg_stat_plans &mdash; track per-plan call counts, execution times and EXPLAIN texts</title>

 </indexterm>

 <para>
  The <filename>pg_stat_plans</filename> module provides a means for
  tracking per-plan statistics and plan texts of all SQL statements executed by
  a server.
 </para>

 <para>
  The module must be loaded by adding <literal>pg_stat_plans</literal> to
  <xref linkend="guc-shared-preload-libraries"/> in
  <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>, because it requires additional shared memory.
  This means that a server restart is needed to add or remove the module.
  In addition, query and plan identifier calculation must be enabled in order for the
  module to be active by setting both <xref linkend="guc-compute-plan-id"/> to
  <literal>auto</literal> or <literal>on</literal> and
  <xref linkend="guc-compute-query-id"/> to <literal>auto</literal> or <literal>on</literal>.
 </para>

 <para>
   When <filename>pg_stat_plans</filename> is active, it tracks
   statistics across all databases of the server.  To access and manipulate
   these statistics, the module provides the <structname>pg_stat_plans</structname>
   view and the utility functions <function>pg_stat_plans_reset</function> and
   <function>pg_stat_plans</function>.  These are not available globally but
   can be enabled for a specific database with
   <command>CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_plans</command>.
 </para>

 <sect2 id="pgstatplans-pg-stat-plans">
  <title>The <structname>pg_stat_plans</structname> View</title>

  <para>
   The statistics gathered by the module are made available via a
   view named <structname>pg_stat_plans</structname>.  This view
   contains one row for each distinct combination of database ID, user
   ID, whether it's a top-level statement or not, query ID and plan ID
   (up to the maximum number of distinct plans that the module can track).
   The columns of the view are shown in <xref linkend="pgstatplans-columns"/>.

       Plan text of a representative plan. This is similar to the output of
       <literal>EXPLAIN (COSTS OFF)</literal>. Note the plan text will contain constant
       values of the first plan recorded, but subsequent executions of the
       same plan hash code (<structfield>planid</structfield>) with different
       constant values will be tracked under the same entry.

  <para>
   For security reasons, only superusers and roles with privileges of the
   <literal>pg_read_all_stats</literal> role are allowed to see the plan text,
   <structfield>queryid</structfield> and <structfield>planid</structfield>
   of queries executed by other users. Other users can see the statistics,
   however, if the view has been installed in their database.
  </para>

  <para>
   Plannable queries (that is, <command>SELECT</command>, <command>INSERT</command>,
   <command>UPDATE</command>, <command>DELETE</command>, and <command>MERGE</command>)
   will have the same <structfield>planid</structfield> whenever they have identical plan
   structures according to an internal hash calculation. Typically, two plans will be
   considered the same for this purpose if they have the same
   <literal>EXPLAIN (COSTS OFF)</literal> output and are semantically equivalent except
   for the values of literal constants appearing in the query plan.
  </para>

  <para>
   Note that queries that have not finished executing yet will show in
   <structname>pg_stat_plans</structname> with their plan text, but without
   the <structname>calls</structname> field being incremented. This can be
   used to identify the query plan for a currently running statement by joining
   <link linkend="monitoring-pg-stat-activity-view">pg_stat_activity</link>
   with <structname>pg_stat_plans</structname>, see example usage in
   <xref linkend="pgstatplans-sample-output"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Consumers of <structname>pg_stat_plans</structname> should use
   <structfield>planid</structfield> in combination with
   <structfield>queryid</structfield>, <structfield>dbid</structfield>,
   <structfield>userid</structfield> and <structfield>toplevel</structfield>
   as a stable and reliable identifier for each entry, instead of using its
   plan text. However, it is important to understand that there are only limited
   guarantees around the stability of the <structfield>planid</structfield>
   hash value.  Since the identifier is derived from the plan tree, its value
   is a function of, among other things, the internal object identifiers
   appearing in this representation. This has some counterintuitive implications.
   For example, <filename>pg_stat_plans</filename> will consider two
   apparently-identical plans to be distinct, if they reference a table
   that was dropped and recreated between the creation of the two plans.
   The hashing process is also sensitive to differences in
   machine architecture and other facets of the platform.
   Furthermore, it is not safe to assume that <structfield>planid</structfield>
   will be stable across major versions of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Two servers participating in replication based on physical WAL replay can
   be expected to have identical <structfield>planid</structfield> values for
   the same plan.  However, logical replication schemes do not promise to
   keep replicas identical in all relevant details, so
   <structfield>planid</structfield> will not be a useful identifier for
   accumulating costs across a set of logical replicas.
   If in doubt, direct testing is recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
   Plan texts are stored in shared memory, and limited in length. To increase
   the maximum length of stored plan texts you can increase
   <varname>pg_stat_plans.max_size</varname>. This value can be changed for
   an individual connection, or set as a server-wide setting.

      The <structname>pg_stat_plans</structname> view is defined in
      terms of a function also named <function>pg_stat_plans</function>.
      It is possible for clients to call
      the <function>pg_stat_plans</function> function directly, and by
      specifying <literal>showplan := false</literal> have plan texts be
      omitted (that is, the <literal>OUT</literal> argument that corresponds
      to the view's <structfield>plan</structfield> column will return nulls).  This
      feature is intended to support external tools that might wish to avoid
      the overhead of repeatedly retrieving plan texts of indeterminate
      length.  Such tools can instead cache the first plan text observed
      for each entry themselves, since that is
      all <filename>pg_stat_plans</filename> itself does, and then retrieve
      plan texts only as needed.
